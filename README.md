# Algorithms-I-Coursera-Princeton
This repo represents the programming assignments form Cousera online course, Introduction to Algorithms, created by Princeton University, taught by: Kevin Wayne, Senior Lecturer and Robert Sedgewick, Professor.

# Here are description for the assignments in order (still working on them).
## 1-Percolation:
Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.

The problem : what is the probability that the system percolates?
It has no closed formula to get this probability so Monte Carlo simulation should be used.
