The main() method takes two command-line arguments n and T, performs T independent computational experiments on an n-by-n grid, and prints the sample mean, sample standard deviation, and the 95% confidence interval for the percolation threshold.

## Ex:
java PercolationStats 200 100 (command)

outputs:
mean                    = 0.5929934999999997
stddev                  = 0.00876990421552567
95% confidence interval = [0.5912745987737567, 0.5947124012262428]
